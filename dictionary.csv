helpText3, "Summary information of models and their quality is provided for each station.
                               The reported RMSE is from the ensemble model and is assessed on a test set that is unseen during training.
                               The ensemble model is a simple 'linear blend' of the individual models trained.
                               The performance of the individual models is shown in the corresponding tables
                               (see also documentation on caretEnsemble for more information).", 
helpText4, "A delay coordinate embedding approach is utlizied.
                               For all models, lagged decadal (10-day) data from the closest meteorological station is utilized
                               together with the past lagged values from the corresponding discharge time series.
                               A lag five has been deemed optimal for performance. Seasonality is accounted for by adding
                               a decade identifier to the predictor list.",
